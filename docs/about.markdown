**Alby Penney**

*Student, Adventurer, Nature & Transit Enthusiast*

My name is Alby Penney and I am an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I originally built this website to share my year studying abroad in Switzerland, but I have expanded it to highlight my personal projects and passions.

I build this website with a customized version of the minima theme using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
